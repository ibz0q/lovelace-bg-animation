### Install with HACS 

Search "Live Background Animations" in HACS and Install.

### Install manually

Download latest release zip. Extract `dist` into a new folder inside www: homeassistant\config\www\lovelace-background-animation ***e.g.***
```
homeassistant\config\www\lovelace-background-animation\
homeassistant\config\www\lovelace-background-animation\dist\
homeassistant\config\www\lovelace-background-animation\dist\bg-animation.min.js
...
```

Go to Lovelace dashboard: Edit -> Manage Resources -> Add resource -> URL: /local/lovelace-bg-animation/dist/bg-animation.min.js -> Javascript Module and click Create.

--- 

A config needs to be placed inside Lovelaces config file, you can do this inside the Lovelace UI > Edit mode > Raw Configuration Editor.

### Minimal Configuration (to get started)

```yaml
bg-animation:
  duration: 60000 # Global duration of each bg
  gallery:
    type: local
  transparency: # Sets the header transparent (Optional)
    header:
      enable: true
  background:
    global: # Add and remove as required
      - id: animation.88.fish-tank
      - id: animation.64.howls-moving-castle
      - id: animation.17.ribbons
      - id: animation.63.green-circuit
      - id: animation.58.browniandrix-noise-l3
      - id: animation.53.stars
      - id: animation.50.sidelined
      
```
### Configuration options (Advanced)
` * = Optional `

```yaml
bg-animation: 
  duration: 50000 # * Duration of the animation in milliseconds (global)
  loadTimeout: 5000 # * In milliseconds - When Iframe takes longer than this value to load, it is forced to be displayed
  cache: true # * If false, nothing will be cached
  conditions: # *
    regex_device_map: # Any names of your devices 'iPhone12ProMax'
       iPhone12ProMax: # An array of regex patterns
         -  AppleWebKit.*12PROMAX.*
       FullKioskBrowserHallway:
         -  .*FullyKioskBrowserHallway.*
  transition: # *
    enable: true
    duration: 1000 # Transition duration in milliseconds
  parentStyle: "position: fixed; right: 0; top: 0; min-width: 100vw; min-height: 100vh; z-index: -10;" # * Root container style
  transparency: # *
    header:
      enable: true # Enable header transparency
      style: ".header {background: transparent !important;}" # Custom header style
    sidebar:

    manifestFileName: "gallery.manifest" # Gallery manifest filename
    remoteRootUrl: "https://ibz0q.github.io/lovelace-bg-animation" # Remote gallery URL
  sort: "random" # * Order backgrounds will be displayed: "random" | "reverse" | "id_asc" | "id_desc"
  background:
    global: # Global background settings
      - id: animation.11.space # Background identifier
        style: "min-width: 100vw; min-height: 100vh; border:0; overflow: hidden;" # * Custom iframe style
        cache: true # * Enable caching for this background
        duration: false # * Override global duration
        redraw: 5000 # * Redraws the iframe - must be above 500 ms otherwise ignored.
        conditions: # *
          include_users: [username1, username2] # Only show for these users
          exclude_users: [username3] # Don't show for these users

          duration: 40000
          conditions: # *
            exclude_users: [ibz] # Exclude these users

```

There's also a card that let's you control bg's:

```YAML
type: custom:lovelace-bg-animation
```

## Contributions

PRs need to be attached to an issue that contains the following info:

- Image Preview
- name: description: author: source: 
- Does the package contain any of the following?
  - Javascript,
  -  Uncompiled code like pug, scss
- Have you audited the code yourself?

 
## Motivation

People created some pretty inspiring animations when HTML5/Canvas/JS/CSS3/Flash was new. There's still amazing artists doing this today. I wanted to curate these, use them on my Home Assistant tablet/dashboard, which incidentally make great backgrounds.

Unfortunately over time many older web experiments/animations have been lost to digital oblivion. Sometimes I would save these locally. I have tried my best to find references and credit the artists, archive.org links provided if they are available - This is not always the case.

### License 

This project is compromised of the works of artists each with their own licensing, none of THIS projects license are imposed. Copyrights and original licenses are preserved respectively. The reason for this is a lot of the works are published online under MIT license, ie. <a href="https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/licensing/#:~:text=The%20gist%20of%20it%20is,it%20is%20subject%20to%20removal">Code Pen</a> which is permissive and expects an equally permissive license or some were created at a time when licensing wasn't really a thing on the web. In some cases works aren't as permissive, or unlicensed. For this reason, code solely belonging to this repo (bg-animation.js) uses CC BY-NC 4.0 Deed Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International which prevents commercial use and works themselves have licenses preserved.

- Security

    - "Official bg packages" vs "Community packages" via YAML tagging
    - Provide a list of vetted libraries or CDNs
  - Provide a way to add libraries in a trusted manner (Done, docs incoming)
